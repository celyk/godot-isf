# Godot ISF

[WIP]
The addon allows importing an ISF file (.fs) to a PackedScene that contains the buffers and shaders required to replicate the effect.

After I get most features working, I hope to add an export button so that Godot can be used for developing ISF!

# Usage

To use the addon, drag in your .fs files to the project directory. The scene that is generated can be dragged in.

# Support

You can support this addon by reporting bugs and donating on kofi
